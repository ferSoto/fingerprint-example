# Fingerprint scanner example (Android)

It's just an example of how to use fingerprint scanner in Android SDK 27.

If there's not a device with finger scanner on hand, the Android Emulator provides the tools to simulate a finger put on the scanner.

This example is based on [this](https://www.androidauthority.com/how-to-add-fingerprint-authentication-to-your-android-app-747304/) and [this](https://dev.to/adammc331/android-fingerprint-authentication-tutorial-2835) tutorials.
